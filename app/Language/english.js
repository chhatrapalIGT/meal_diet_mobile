  title: 'Mastering Emotional Eating:',
  subtitle: 'Practical Tips to Overcome Stress-Induced Hunger',
  topPara1: 'Emotional eating, or stress-induced hunger, is a common behavior where we use food to cope with emotions like stress, anxiety, loneliness, or boredom. This can lead to unhealthy eating habits and impact our overall well-being.',
  topPara2: 'Here are some practical tips to identify and manage this behavior constructively.',
  tipTextBold1: 'Identify your emotions:',
  tipTextLight1: 'Try to distinguish between physical hunger and emotional hunger. Ask yourself: Am I truly hungry, or am I eating because I feel stressed, sad, or bored?',
  tipTextBold2: 'Create a routine:',
  tipTextLight2: 'Eat regular meals and snacks to keep blood sugar levels stable and avoid overeating.',
  tipTextBold3: 'Distract yourself:',
  tipTextLight3: 'When cravings hit, try doing something else for 10 minutes, like taking a walk, reading a book, or calling a friend.',
  tipTextBold4: 'Keep a journal:',
  tipTextLight4: 'Document your feelings and eating habits to identify patterns and triggers.',
  tipTextBold5: 'Choose healthy options:',
  tipTextLight5: 'If the craving doesn’t go away, opt for nutritious snacks like fruits, nuts, or yogurt.',
  tipTextBold6: 'Practice mindfulness:',
  tipTextLight6: 'Focus on eating slowly and paying attention to flavors, smells, and textures to improve your relationship with food.',
  tipTextBold7: 'Stay hydrated:',
  tipTextLight7: 'Thirst is often mistaken for hunger. Drink a glass of water before deciding to eat something.',
  tipTextBold8: 'Set limits on comfort foods:',
  tipTextLight8: 'Keep small portions of “comfort foods” available to avoid overindulging.',
  tipTextBold9: 'Build a support network:',
  tipTextLight9: 'Talk to friends or a therapist about your feelings instead of turning to food.',
  tipTextBold10: 'Get enough sleep:',
  tipTextLight10: 'Sleep deprivation increases stress and hunger hormones, which can lead to overeating.',
  bottomPara1: 'Managing emotional eating can be challenging, but with the right strategies, you can take control of your eating habits and build a healthier relationship with food. Start with small changes and be patient with yourself. If you find it hard to do this alone, don\'t hesitate to seek support from a friend, therapist, or nutrition expert. Your health and well-being are worth the effort.',
